South Korea is facing a societal problem called "Aging Society". The government estimates nearly a quarter of the country's population will be elderly by the year 2030. And, the country has one of the lowest birth rates in the world â€” meaning fewer people to support them. CCTV is looking at those dying alone and efforts to help them during their last days.

The **Digital Companion Robot** is an Elder-care Robot which is being studied to solve the problems for the elderly in an aging society, such as talking to the elderly and detecting and counteracting emergency situations. This allows the elderly to experience these digital partners in advance in virtual reality and shows how elderly in future and robots can interact and coexist.


In this work, we have established a VR experimental environment to alleviate depression and social isolation in the elderly. In order for digital companies to play their role, they had to comprehensively consider various design factors, such as what services the elderly needed and what designs they preferred.

We collected data on the lifestyle and design preferences of the elderly through **Living Lab** and a large-scale in-depth study of the elderly. In addition, a scenario was developed by interviewing a group of occupations related to the elderly to derive services necessary for the elderly. It then implemented a digital companion designed based on the elderly data collected to listen to the evaluation of the elderly, who are actual users, in virtual reality.

Elderly people who participated in VR experiments wear VR devices and meet partners in virtual reality. The scenario consists of data collected from more than 200 elderly people. The elderly experience interactions with the companion in various situations, such as a companion in virtual reality welcoming them at the entrance and informing them of the hospital schedule. Older people who meet a companion in a virtual environment are "better than their family." "I think they will be less lonely."said most of them positively.

Elderly people experience digital partners in virtual reality and evaluate the design, acceptability, usability, appropriateness of functions, and satisfaction of the companion. The collected user evaluation data is actively reflected in the development and commercialization of digital partners along with existing elderly data.

As the elderly society enters, the development of robots that can solve the elderly problem is becoming more active. Using the VR experimental environment, the elderly experience and evaluate partners themselves, so they can reflect more practical preferences and requirements for the elderly than before.

In addition, the elderly will be able to communicate with partners in virtual reality, reduce their rejection of the partners, and increase intimacy.
