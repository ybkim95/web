ICRAâ€™s RoboMaster challenge asks teams to use the same hardware to build one or a pair of these rovers. Instead of human pilots, these rovers must be fully autonomous. The AI challenge asks teams to build rovers that can sense the environment around themselves, navigate an arena, and engage in combat with the opposing team. Rovers will need to move around the battlefield, a five by eight meter space, launching projectiles and trying to avoid incoming hits. At the end of match, the team that has scored the most hits on their opponents will be declared the winner.
