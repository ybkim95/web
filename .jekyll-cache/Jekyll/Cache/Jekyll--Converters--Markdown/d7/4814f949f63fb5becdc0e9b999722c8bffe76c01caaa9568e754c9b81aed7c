<p>The Digital Companion Robot is an Elder-care Robot which is being studied to solve the problems for the elderly in an aging society, such as talking to the elderly and detecting and counteracting emergency situations. This allows the elderly to experience these digital partners in advance in virtual reality and shows how elderly in future and robots can interact and coexist.</p>

<p>TDRC has established a VR experimental environment to alleviate depression and social isolation in the elderly.</p>

<p>In order for digital companies to play their role, they had to comprehensively consider various design factors, such as what services the elderly needed and what designs they preferred.</p>
