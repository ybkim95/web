<h2 id="purposeful-design"><strong>Purposeful Design</strong></h2>

<p>The people who made me have done a great job with my body design, if I do say so myself. Iâ€™m pretty sleek and shiny, and the way I can move all my body segments so smoothly in so many directions, it really lets me interact with the world and express how Iâ€™m feeling.</p>
