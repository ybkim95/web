<p><strong>Task</strong></p>

<p>The task of the competition is solving the MineRLObtainDiamond-v0 environment (or MineRLObtainDiamondVectorObf-v0 for Research track). In this environment, the agent begins in a random starting location without any items, and is tasked with obtaining a diamond. This task can only be accomplished by navigating the complex item hierarchy of Minecraft.</p>
