<p>As an Engineer, I tried to analyze the world in a logical and systematical way based on the engineering knowledge that I have learned. However, there were many values that cannot be judged to be the only truth, I realized that I could not interpret them solely by Engineering knowledge. Accordingly, I became interested not only in Engineering but also in convergence studies where various studies gets combined. My lifetime goal is to make advances in technology by intermingling the various kinds of studies and always strive to create something from that gained knowledge to make a better future.</p>
