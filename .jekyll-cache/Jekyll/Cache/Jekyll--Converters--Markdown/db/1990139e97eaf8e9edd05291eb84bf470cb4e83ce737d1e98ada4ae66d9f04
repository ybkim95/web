<p>The Digital Companion Robot is an Elder-care Robot which is being studied to solve the problems for the elderly in an aging society, such as talking to the elderly and detecting and counteracting emergency situations. This allows the elderly to experience these digital partners in advance in virtual reality and shows how elderly in future and robots can interact and coexist.</p>

<p>TDRC has established a VR experimental environment to alleviate depression and social isolation in the elderly.</p>

<p>In order for digital companies to play their role, they had to comprehensively consider various design factors, such as what services the elderly needed and what designs they preferred.</p>

<p>We collected data on the lifestyle and design preferences of the elderly through Living Lab and a large-scale in-depth study of the elderly. In addition, a scenario was developed by interviewing a group of occupations related to the elderly to derive services necessary for the elderly. It then implemented a digital companion designed based on the elderly data collected to listen to the evaluation of the elderly, who are actual users, in virtual reality.</p>

<p>Elderly people who participated in VR experiments wear VR devices and meet partners in virtual reality. The scenario consists of data collected from more than 200 elderly people. The elderly experience interactions with the companion in various situations, such as a companion in virtual reality welcoming them at the entrance and informing them of the hospital schedule. Older people who meet a companion in a virtual environment are ‚Äúbetter than their family.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think they will be less lonely.‚Äùsaid most of them positively.</p>
