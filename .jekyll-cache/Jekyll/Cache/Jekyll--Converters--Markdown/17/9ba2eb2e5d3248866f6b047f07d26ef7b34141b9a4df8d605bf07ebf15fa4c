<p><strong>RFusion</strong> is a robotic system that can search for and retrieve items in line-of-sight, non-line-of-sight, and fully occluded settings. It consists of a robotic arm that has a camera and antenna strapped around its gripper, and it uses both of them to find and retrieve target items.  The robot introduces two new primitives: RF-visual sensing and RF-visual reinforcement learning to efficiently localize, maneuver toward, and grasp target items.</p>

<p>RFusion is very accurate. It localizes target items with centimeter-scale precision and achieves 96% success rate in retrieving fully occluded objects, even if they are under a pile. Thus, it paves the way for novel robotic retrieval tasks in complex environments such as warehouses, manufacturing plants, and smart homes.</p>

<p>The purpose of this work is to clone the RFusionâ€™s work and learn to implement a robotic system that fuses multi-modal datas from the sensors to accomplish a pick-and-place tasks in a cluttered environment where the target item is under a pile.</p>
